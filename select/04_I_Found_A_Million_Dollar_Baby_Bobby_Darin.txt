It was a lucky April shower
It was a most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and dime store.
The rain continued for an hour
I hung around for three or four
Around a million dollar baby
From a five and dime store.
You know that she was selling candy
And when she rolled those eyes
I bought so much candy
Till I was twice my size.
If you should run into a shower
And wanna step inside my door
You'll meet a million dollar baby
From a five and dime store.
